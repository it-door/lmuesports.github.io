                <p> Welcome to LMU Esports! Resurrected in 2016 by Tyler Edmiston and Teddy Chu, LMU Esports has strived to provide a place for students to express themselves 
                    and their love for video games and provide a place to be competitive in a non-traditional sport setting. The club hosts biweekly meetings social events that 
                    often have new video game releases, tabletop games, and food for all students. Our esports teams span across nearly every mainstream game; with the 2019 Spring 
                    season having <b>League of Legends</b>, <b>Overwatch</b>, and <b>Starcraft II</b>. The club also hosts <b>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</b> tournaments for both 
                    the LMU community as well as the Southern California community, attracting upwards of 50 entrants at regional tournaments.
